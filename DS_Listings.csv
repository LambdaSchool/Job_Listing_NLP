Who We Are

Grow Progress gives our customers the power to persuade more people by tailoring their messages to match each audience member’s identity. We help customers harness the latest persuasion science to create messaging that’s typically 200% to 500% more effective than their existing ads. We do this by predicting which personality traits and values are most important to each individual based on their digital footprints.

Ability to create slides and charts that are especially clear for non-technical clients
Strong time management and project management skills, with the ability to handle a lot of different work streams, deadlines, and stakeholders
Progressive values


It’s a plus if you have some of the following bonus skills - but don’t let these be a barrier to applying:

Experience consulting for clients
Advanced SQL skills
Experience working with digital ad platforms like Facebook and YouTube
Familiarity with data visualization tools to deliver insights to customers
Experience working with campaigns or advocacy organizations
Experience working with voter file data and related models
Experience working with a geographically distributed team


More About Grow Progress

Our culture is fun, fast-paced, and focused on evidence. We aim to cultivate an environment where creative hypotheses and evidence drive our decisions rather than just anecdotes, and where everyone feels comfortable contributing ideas — even if it’s on a topic outside of their expertise. We work hard to get smarter together by giving each other feedback that’s direct, actionable, and respectful. We’re deeply motivated by the work we do and committed to using this technology ethically, so we’re looking for teammates who feel the same way.

These companies are now worth over $155B combined. YC has built programs that support founders throughout the life of their company. Many of our services were created by YC alumni who later became YC partners — so, we understand the challenges involved with building a company. We help founders navigate their biggest challenges — from learning how to start a company, to finding customers, to raising funding and hiring their first employees, to raising a Series A and scaling beyond.

About the role

Twice a year, we receive tens of thousands of applications from promising startups all around the world. Reviewing these applications is one of the most important aspects of YC’s business. You will be the point person for data pipeline, analysis and modeling efforts, primarily focusing on admissions data. While fundamentally a technical role, promising candidates should also be excellent communicators, proactively seek out strategic opportunities to improve processes, and be open to doing non-technical tasks like reviewing startup applications.
In this role, you will support efforts in the following domains:
Build new admissions software features
Conduct exploratory analysis on admissions data to inform strategic decision making.
Collaborate with software engineering to maintain and extend existing data infrastructure.
Build machine learning models to support admissions processes.
Develop internal tools for parsing unstructured data.
Understand the admissions pipeline and determine new ways to improve data collection, search and review.

Strong candidates will be comfortable with handling a diverse set of tasks - from modeling the expected number of applications in a given batch to building dashboards to help us track those applications to helping review them.

We are looking for someone senior enough to know best practices, but still excited to get their hands dirty. You should understand and know how to choose the right tool for any given data problem, even if that tool ends up being a survey or talking to users face to face. YC started as a family business, and we look for low-ego people who prioritize getting the job done over tool or title.

This is a good job for someone who is excited about startups and interested in learning more about them. You’ve likely started a startup, or want to do so in the future.

Location & Benefits

The YC admissions team is based in downtown SF. We can help you move here, but don't hire people who can only work remotely.

We offer highly competitive compensation (even with the top tech companies in the valley) and even equity in YC.

Data Scientist,Brightloom,"Seattle, WA",,"The Role:
Brightloom is creating an entirely new category of software-as-a-service for consumer brands -- the Customer Growth Platform. This first-of-its-kind platform enables automated digital engagement and personalized loyalty programs to transform customer experiences while delivering predictable and repeatable lifetime value growth for brands.

As a Data Scientist on our Customer Growth Platform, you'll develop predictive data products, such as product demand forecasts, customer lifetime valuation, personalized product recommendations, and more. Then you'll develop optimization algorithms based on these predictive data products, for brands to use in their marketing and offers so they can efficiently maximize growth. The experimentation solutions you develop should prove the value of our suggestions, as well as help train future predictive models about what products and offers will drive customer engagement.

What You'll Do:

Data platform design: work your way up the Data Science Hierarchy of Needs ( https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007 ). You'll partner with software engineering and product management counterparts to design our data and machine learning infrastructure, including collection, storage, processing, experiment design, modeling, and finally automated optimization.
Data normalization and integrity: we'll be importing highly heterogeneous data from a variety of customers across thousands locations with millions of customers. This will require clever solutions to ensure the data they send us is readily available, easy to use and reliable.
Predictive modeling and data products: you'll be the primary contributor on the models that power our forecasting and recommendations, which are at the core of this role and our Customer Growth Platform offering.
Experimentation & impact analysis: outbound marketing automation, including paid media, product discounts and loyalty reward offers, often costs consumer brands real money. Through rigorous experiment design, including power analysis, and execution you will prove to our customers that our predictions are accurate and our optimizations deliver impact. When experimentation isn't an option, you'll develop causal inference models to measure impact.
Data visualization & reporting: you'll partner with our product management team to define and build proof-of-concept dashboards, analysis and reporting for the data we receive from customers, the predictive data products we produce from it, and the automated optimization and experimentation we run based on those.

About You:

MS in a quantitative discipline such as Statistics, Mathematics, Data Science, Business Analytics, Economics, Finance, Engineering, or Computer Science
2+ years of professional experience with demonstrated success using complex data analysis or machine learning model development to solve business needs
Expertise in at least one statistical software package or language such as R, Stata, Matlab, or Python
Expertise using big data infrastructure and tools, such as Spark, SageMaker, Athena, Redshift

Bonus Points:

PhD in a related quantitative discipline
Experience with causal inference, applied time series modeling or machine learning forecasting applications
Experience with iterative software development practices such as Agile
Strong written and oral communication skills

About Us:
At Brightloom, we are working to create meaningful relationships between people and the brands they love.

About IPA
Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) is a research and policy nonprofit that discovers and promotes effective solutions to global poverty problems. IPA brings together researchers and decision-makers to design, rigorously evaluate, and refine these solutions and their applications, ensuring that the evidence created is used to improve the lives of the world’s poor. In recent decades, trillions of dollars have been spent on programs designed to reduce global poverty, but clear evidence on which programs succeed is rare, and when evidence does exist, decision-makers often do not know about it. IPA exists to bring together leading researchers and these decision-makers to ensure that the evidence we create leads to tangible impact on the world. Since its founding in 2002, IPA has worked with over 575 leading academics to conduct over 650 evaluations in 51 countries. This research has informed hundreds of successful programs that now impact millions of individuals worldwide.

Machine Learning is a critical part of Adobe’s Cloud offering. Adobe Clouds enable customers to create and manage digital content, such as assets, composites, 3D, documents etc., and digital experience and transformations.

Creative Cloud is focused on visual imagination and creation, and includes such well-known products as Photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, Lightroom CC, and Adobe Stock. Document Cloud is centered around the creation and management of textual documents, including Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign. Experience Cloud is the set of offerings for the large-scale enterprise, covering marketing, advertising, and analytics.

We are building new machine learning platform, called Adobe Sensei, that powers machine learning and AI across all of these Adobe Cloud product lines.

The objective is to make machine learning offerings a world-class, leading-edge, differentiating product in Adobe Cloud ecosystem. We match the pace, innovation and excitement of a startup, backed by the resources and infrastructure of Adobe!


A crucial piece of developing machine learning solutions is the evaluation process. How do we know the quality of our algorithms and models? What is the ground truth we use for judging them? Where do they succeed and how do they fail? These problems are even more subtle in the complex, creative domains of Adobe products – for example, how should we judge the quality of similarity search, where a user finds new images with an image as the query?


Equally core to the ML process is the training set itself. Such training sets often include human judgments, elicted at large scale, which form the target that the ML process predicts.


How can you participate? We’re looking for data scientists to define, drive, and coordinate evaluation and training set construction for the Applied Machine Learning team at Adobe. This will involve thinking hard about product quality, the role of machine learning in those products, and the capabilities of both A/B tests and human-judgment tasks to produce training sets for ML as well as quantitative evaluations that measure how well our AI/ML algorithms are doing their jobs

Responsibilities:

Work closely with product, research, and engineering leaders to understand ML applications and define success
Design evaluation tasks and guidelines for human judgment to measure the performance of machine-learned and other advanced algorithms.
Design human judgment tasks that will create training sets for useful machine-learned models.
Create a winning culture built on collaboration and shared accomplishments- have fun along the way!
Qualifications:

BS or MS in a technical field (Computer Science, Physics, Math, Statistics) OR in a human-centered field such as Psychology, Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction.
Exposure to applied machine learning in an industrial setting
Experience in validation and evaluation of machine learned models
Strong quantitative orientation
Understanding of issues around ground truth and training sets for ML, including human judgment and A/B testing
Hands-on experience using third-party judgment services such as Crowdflower, Appen, or Amazon Mechanical Turk

Data Scientist,Pivotal Software,"Washington, DC",,"LOCATION: Remote (home based) with some travel to New York, Washington DC, Boston.


About Us VIDEO

Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

You

As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.

The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:

Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.

Required Skills / Experiences

Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.

Desired Skills / Experiences

2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.

Spring is accelerating the discovery of therapies for aging and its related
diseases
[https://medium.com/spring-discovery/accelerating-the-discovery-of-therapies-for-aging-and-its-related-diseases-7c6a2109189f]. Machine learning and data science are at our core, and we're building a rare computational team that works closely with our biologists, together fighting disease.

Impact
Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Yes, you belong
We are building a cross-functional team. We don't expect you to have a background in biology, just as we don't expect our biologists to be experts in ML. We do expect our teams to work respectfully and closely, learning together every day.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.

About you

Experience. You have 3+ years of real-world experience in data science, software development, or machine learning.
Statistical intuition. You're comfortable dealing with data and forming and testing hypotheses. You have a developed sense of whether analysis lacks rigor and how to improve it.
Tends towards ownership. You do anything necessary to solve the problem at hand.
Maturity in face of ambiguity. You help define questions instead of just answering them. You work to resolve ambiguity — and you're comfortable making decisions when it remains.
Crisp communicator. You excel at crisp, concise written or spoken communication. You love learning and teaching others in a cross-functional team (we're biologists, computational folks, and more).
Driven by impact. You're most motivated when working on a problem of important consequence, no matter what's necessary to do so.

Nice to have

Biological data experience. You bring familiarity with the pitfalls and analytical techniques typically encountered with large biological datasets.
Deep learning intuition. You bring intuition about datasets and experiment structures for deep learning from personal experience.
Scientific background. You have cultural familiarity with scientists and labs from personal experience. You know the language of scientists as well as that of the technical world.

Benefits

Competitive salary and equity in a growing, well-funded startup
Excellent medical, dental, and vision coverage
Generous vacation policy
Healthy feedback-focused environment — leadership will have high expectations, regularly share constructive feedback, expect you to grow, and welcome receiving feedback from you

A unique moment
We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

And at the same time, we're just getting started. You're joining a team that has the funding needed to be ambitious while still early enough to help define our culture, choices, and success. Our expectations of you — and of ourselves — are high.

Associate Data Scientist,Levelset,"Austin, TX 78701",,"Each month over 500,000 contractors and suppliers connect on Levelset's cloud-based platform to make payment processes stress-free. Users easily exchange payment documents like lien waivers, pay applications, and preliminary notices, they see a complete picture of who is on their job, and are empowered with the resources and knowledge they need to be confident in payment. The results are faster payments and fewer surprises.
All of this activity generates millions of entities, records, attribution, and entity relationships. We use this data to create insights about the payment activity of projects and contractors, which helps our users get paid. That's where you come in.
You'll be Levelset's first Data Scientist and have the opportunity to influence how we expand our data science use cases across the business and products. You will need to be a ""data utility player"" and be prepared to be able to move data around, analyze opportunities, select the tools and build the infrastructure to support data science, and use our data to innovate our product and advance our purpose. The work you do and models you build will have a direct impact on our users.
Types of projects you'll be working on:

Text Analysis and Entity Recognition
We send thousands of documents and ingest thousands more from external sources. This data is messy, sometimes unstructured, and we need to be smarter about how we correlate company entities. How can we tell if two companies with similar names are the same or different?
We are collecting thousands of reviews from our users to capture feedback on different contractors on things like payment timeliness, communication practices, etc… How can we summarize the overall sentiment of reviews for a specific contractor and what are the common pros / cons?
Advanced Analytics and Data Discovery
We have a lot of data on the payment history of contractors. How can we rate the payment risk of a contractor and share that information with users in a helpful, digestible way?
A large commercial construction project can last many years and include hundreds of contractors. Or a single address can have multiple projects over the years with different contractors. Or a property, like an office building, can have different distinct projects going on at one time. How can we tell the difference?
Data Modeling and Heuristics
A user is on a project that we know other subcontractors are experiencing slow payment on. What other documents should we recommend the user do to ensure they get paid?
Most of the construction industry is based on working relationships and prior work history. What relationships and other parties can we infer that are working on the project based on the existing connections from other projects we see in our graph?

Skills you'll need:

1-3 years of experience working with Machine Learning, Optimization, Neural Networks and/or Artificial Intelligence
A broad understanding of data science techniques and a willingness to ""go deep"" and learn more about a specific topic as it relates to our opportunities.
Data cleansing experience using various utilities and programming techniques
Text analytics, natural language processing, and entity recognition/extraction to turn documents into information
Data processing / ETL to prep and clean data for analysis and production pipelines.
R / Python / SQL / Cypher.
You'll be helping us build our DS stack out, but familiarity with the tools we have in place will help, including: MySQL, Redshift/Postgres, Neo4j, Kafka, RabbitMQ, and the AWS stack.

Why Levelset?

Levelset is one of the South's fastest-growing tech companies with 100% growth year over year. Named New Orleans City Business ""Best Place to Work,"" ""Top Company Culture"" by Entrepreneur Magazine, part of the Inc. 5,000 fastest growing companies, and voted best company for leadership, perks and benefits, work-life balance, and professional development as well as best CEO for woman and diversity by Comparably.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.",http://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=2afdf54c472105e8&fccid=34e432285076b351&vjs=3

Data Scientist - Global Optimization,Stitch Fix,"San Francisco, CA",,"About the Team

The Global Optimization team is focused on solving business-facing problems that cut across organizational and functional boundaries of the company. We seek to ensure that Stitch Fix's systems are operating at their global optimum rather than at local optima-as might occur if each system were optimized independently.

We conceived, built, maintain, and improve the inventory targeting algorithm - the technical system that allows Stitch Fix to optimize the outcomes for all clients simultaneously given our product inventory constraints.

About the Role

You will design, implement, and experimentally test improvements to the inventory targeting algorithm.

You will leverage the client-product matching information provided by the inventory targeting algorithm to enhance cross-team visibility into product and client performance to improve all stages of the client and merchandise lifecycles.

As an example, this could mean providing client-specific inventory health information to the marketing team so that they can choose to acquire clients that will have a good experience given our present inventory. It may also mean providing client-segment specific information about the products for which demand most exceeds supply so that the merchandise buying team can focus on buying items that improve client experience the most.

You're excited about this opportunity because you will…
Requires you to think about a large, functioning, successful business as an organic whole rather than focusing on a small slice
Allows you to operate as a ""full stack"" data scientist participating in every stage of development from idea to proof-of-principle to production

Avoid getting ""blocked"" by working with a bias to action in the presence of ambiguity
Know how to find the right balance of rigor and pragmatism in a given context
Are able to identify new opportunities to improve algorithms and effectively prioritize among them
Are bright, kind, and motivated by challenge
You will love working at Stitch Fix because we...
Are a successful, fast-growing company with a start-up work vibe.
